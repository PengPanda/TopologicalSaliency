# [Saliency Detection Inspired by Topological Perception Theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-021-01478-4)

## 1. Introduction
* A computational model of the [topological perception theory](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506280444000256) from [Lin Chen](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E9%9C%96/5625357?fr=aladdin);
* A statistic experiment to reveal the close relation between topological perception theory and visual attention (saliency);
* Topological saliency prior-guided saliency detection and salient object detection framework.
